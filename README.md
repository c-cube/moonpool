# Moonpool

A pool within a bigger pool (ie the ocean). Here, we're talking about
pools of [Thread.t] which live within a fixed pool of [Domain.t].

## Usage

The user can create several thread pools. These pools use regular posix threads,
but the threads are spread across multiple domains (on OCaml 5), which enables
parallelism.

```ocaml
# #require "moonpool";;
# let pool = Moonpool.Pool.create ~min:4 ();;
val pool : Moonpool.Pool.t = <abstr>

# let rec fib x =
    if x <= 1 then 1 else fib (x-1) + fib (x-2);;
val fib : int -> int = <fun>

# List.init 10 fib;;
- : int list = [1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34; 55]

# let fibs = Array.init 30 (fun n -> Moonpool.Fut.spawn ~on:pool (fun () -> fib n));;
val fibs : int Moonpool.Fut.t array =
  [|<abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>;
    <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>;
    <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>;
    <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>; <abstr>|]

# Moonpool.Fut.join_array fibs |> Moonpool.Fut.wait_block;;
- : int array Moonpool.or_error =
Ok
 [|1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34; 55; 89; 144; 233; 377; 610; 987; 1597; 2584;
   4181; 6765; 10946; 17711; 28657; 46368; 75025; 121393; 196418; 317811;
   514229; 832040|]
```

## OCaml versions

This works for OCaml >= 4.05.
- On OCaml 4.xx, there are no domains, so this is just a library for regular thread pools
    with not actual parallelism (except for threads that call C code that releases the runtime lock, that is).
- on OCaml 5.xx, there is a fixed pool of domains (using the recommended domain count).
    These domains do not do much by themselves, but we schedule new threads on them, and group
    threads from each domain into pools.
    Each domain might thus have multiple threads that belong to distinct pools (and several threads from
    the same pool, too â€” this is useful for threads blocking on IO).

    A useful analogy is that each domain is a bit like a CPU core, and `Thread.t` is a logical thread running on a core.
    Multiple threads have to share a single core and do not run in parallel on it[^1].
    We can therefore build pools that spread their worker threads on multiple cores to enable parallelism within each pool.

TODO: actually use https://github.com/haesbaert/ocaml-processor to pin domains to cores,
possibly optionally using `select` in dune.
