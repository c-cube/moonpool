# rayml

![Example rendered scene](examples/demo.jpg)

A raytracer written in OCaml. It supports diffuse("matte") and
reflective("metallic") surfaces.

The design of the software roughly follows Peter Shirley's mini-book
series [Raytracing in One Weekend][weekend] which presents a raytracer
in C++. I've adopted the programming style to suit the OCaml's
functional style.
