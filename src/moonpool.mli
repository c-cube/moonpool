  pools of [Thread.t] which live within a fixed pool of [Domain.t].

  (** Already settled future, with a failure *)

  val of_result : 'a or_error -> 'a t

  (** {2 Combinators} *)

  val spawn : on:Pool.t -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a t
  (** [spaw ~on f] runs [f()] on the given pool, and return a future that will
      hold its result. *)

  (** [map ?on ~f fut] returns a new future [fut2] that resolves
      with [f x] if [fut] resolved with [x];
      and fails with [e] if [fut] fails with [e] or [f x] raises [e].
      @param on if provided, [f] runs on the given pool *)

  val bind : ?on:Pool.t -> f:('a -> 'b t) -> 'a t -> 'b t
  (** [map ?on ~f fut] returns a new future [fut2] that resolves
      like the future [f x] if [fut] resolved with [x];
    and fails with [e] if [fut] fails with [e] or [f x] raises [e].
      @param on if provided, [f] runs on the given pool *)

  val join_array : 'a t array -> 'a array t
  (** Wait for all the futures in the array. Fails if any future fails. *)

  val join_list : 'a t list -> 'a list t
  (** Wait for all the futures in the list. Fails if any future fails. *)

  val for_ : on:Pool.t -> int -> (int -> unit) -> unit t
  (** [for_ ~on n f] runs [f 0], [f 1], â€¦, [f (n-1)] on the pool, and returns
      a future that resolves when all the tasks have resolved, or fails
      as soon as one task has failed. *)

  (** {2 Blocking} *)

  val wait_block : 'a t -> 'a or_error
  (** [wait_block fut] blocks the current thread until [fut] is resolved,
      and returns its value.

      A word of warning: this can easily cause deadlocks. A good rule to avoid
      deadlocks is to run this from outside of any pool, or to have an acyclic order
      between pools where [wait_block] is only called from a pool on futures evaluated
      in a pool that comes lower in the hierarchy.
      If this rule is broken, it is possible for all threads in a pool to wait for
      futures that can only make progress on these same threads, hence the deadlock.

  val wait_block_exn : 'a t -> 'a
  (** Same as {!wait_block} but re-raises the exception if the future failed. *)
