(** Futures.

    A future of type ['a t] represents the result of a computation
    that will yield a value of type ['a].

    Typically, the computation is running on a thread pool {!Runner.t}
    and will proceed on some worker. Once set, a future cannot change.
    It either succeeds (storing a [Ok x] with [x: 'a]), or fail
    (storing a [Error (exn, bt)] with an exception and the corresponding
    backtrace).

    Combinators such as {!map} and {!join_array} can be used to produce
    futures from other futures (in a monadic way). Some combinators take
    a [on] argument to specify a runner on which the intermediate computation takes
    place; for example [map ~on:pool ~f fut] maps the value in [fut]
    using function [f], applicatively; the call to [f] happens on
    the runner [pool] (once [fut] resolves successfully with a value).

(** {2 Blocking} *)

val wait_block : 'a t -> 'a or_error
(** [wait_block fut] blocks the current thread until [fut] is resolved,
      and returns its value.

      {b NOTE}: A word of warning: this will monopolize the calling thread until the future
      resolves. This can also easily cause deadlocks, if enough threads in a pool
      call [wait_block] on futures running on the same pool or a pool depending on it.

      A good rule to avoid deadlocks is to run this from outside of any pool,
      or to have an acyclic order between pools where [wait_block]
      is only called from a pool on futures evaluated in a pool that comes lower
      in the hierarchy.
      If this rule is broken, it is possible for all threads in a pool to wait
      for futures that can only make progress on these same threads,
      hence the deadlock.
